Project Title: 
Factory Simulation Project

Author: 
Charlie Karun  

Overview:
A discrete-event factory simulation built in Python to model and optimize production line performance. 
Includes an interactive interface for adjusting machine parameters, visualizing throughput data, 
and analyzing efficiency improvements through iterative testing and system balancing.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- SimPy
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit

Features:
- Adjustable machine and process parameters
- Real-time Matplotlib charts and visualizations
- Efficiency and throughput analysis
- Interactive Streamlit interface
- Iterative testing and line balancing

Installation and Setup:
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ckaru1/factory_sim.git
2. Navigate into the folder:
   cd factory_sim
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   python -m venv .venv; source .venv/bin/activate
4. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run the app:
   streamlit run factory_sim.py

Usage Instructions:
- Open the Streamlit interface in your browser
- Adjust machine cycle times, variability, and buffer sizes
- Click “Run Simulation” to visualize system performance and efficiency
- Review throughput plots and metrics for analysis
